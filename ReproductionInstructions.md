## Running Presentation Notebook
The presentation notebook which shows the data engineering, visualization, modeling, and recommendations for this notebook is best run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). I recommend opening the notebook in google colab by linking from [GitHub](https://github.com/SSGrasland/Modeling-Hurricane-Impact-on-Florida-Real-Estate-Value-/blob/main/notebooks/0.PresentationNotebook.ipynb). Data can be automatically downloaded directly from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sgrasland/hurricane-impact-on-florida-real-estate) into the notebook using a [Kaggle API Key](https://www.kaggle.com/settings/account)

## Running Other Notebooks 
All data used in this project is available in the data folder. The data can be processed using the notebooks in numerical order. The environment used is available as a .yml file found in the root directory. 

## Downloading the Data
